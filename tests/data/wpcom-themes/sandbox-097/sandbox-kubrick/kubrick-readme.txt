== ABOUT ==

Pulled from http://andy.wordpress.com/2006/07/20/generated-semantic-classes-2/ by SCOTT on ANDY's behalf. ;-)

Although I do consider myself style-blind, I did tackle the problem of creating the first complete Sandbox skin. Actually I dropped in the Kubrick stylesheet and tweaked it to work with Sandbox. It does a very nice job of emulating Kubrick – with a few improvements.

This theme is a modification of the default WordPress theme, also known as Kubrick. Original design by Michael Heilemann, http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/kubrick/.


== USING THIS DESIGN ==

To use the Kubrick design with the Sandbox, simply replace everything after the commented-out header in the root style.css file with

	@import url('sandbox-kubrick/kubrick-style.css');


== IMPORTANT FOR WORDPRESS 2.0.X USERS ==

If you intend to use this design with the Sandbox running WordPress 2.0.x, please note you will need to update the name of an image in the design CSS: kubrickbg-ltr.jpg => kubrickbg.jpg.

This is because of language support introduced in WordPress 2.2 and left-to-right vs. right-to-left variables.
