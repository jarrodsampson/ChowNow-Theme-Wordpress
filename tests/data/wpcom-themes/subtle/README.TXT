DESCRIPTION
Based on a joke my brother-in-law made, Subtle is the first public theme 
released by Glued Ideas. Designed for sites that have multiple authors, 
Subtle also makes use of WordPress Widgets, making customization a snap.



FEATURES
-  Built for blogs with multiple authors.
   Each writer can have their own archive and information page.

-  Select which categories of posts you want to show on the front page.

-  Show front page posts in full (as leads) or just the title, or any 
   combination of the two formats that you choose.

-  Supports user-created styling through automated header creation.

-  Download additional looks from other users or at Glued Ideas Development Blog.
   (http://blog.gluedideas.com)

-  Full WordPress Widget Support.

-  Built-in FeedBurner support.

    Header input box.
