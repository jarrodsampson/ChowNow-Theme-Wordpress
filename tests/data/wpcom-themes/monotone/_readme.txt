Monotone Version 1.1

Theme Installation:

1) Copy the folder named "monotone" to your wp-content/themes/ directory.
2) Login to the WordPress administration area and click "Design"
3) Activate the theme!


Thumb.php and .htaccess Installation:

1) Move htaccess.txt and thumb.php to your site's root folder (the one where xmlrpc.php and the wp-admin folder live).
2) Rename htaccess.txt to .htaccess OR copy the lines out of .htaccess and append them to your current .htaccess file.
3) Make a folder with world writable permissions (probably 0777) called "cache" in your site's root directory. This is so thumb.php can cache the images it generates.
3) Everything should work.

Monotone was a collaboration between eight6 (http://eight6.com) and Automattic (http://automattic.com).

All future updates to the theme will be available at http://monotonedemo.wordpress.com
