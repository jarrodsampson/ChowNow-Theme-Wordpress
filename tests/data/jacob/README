The Python scripts are for generating test data, because Python's Unicode
support is much, much, much, much better than PHP's.

 * `generate_remove_accents_tests.py` generates all of the 
    remove_accents_from_* files.
    
    Call it with `python generate_remove_accents_tests.py`

 * `urlencode.py`, `u-urlencode.py` and `entitize.py` process UTF-8
   into a few different formats (%-encoding, %u-encoding, &#decimal;)
   and are used like normal UNIXy pipes.
   
   Try:
   
   `python urlencode.py < utf-8.txt > utf-8-urlencoded.txt`
   `python u-urlencode.py < utf-8.txt > utf-8-u-urlencoded.txt`
   `python entitize.py < utf-8.txt > utf-8-entitized.txt`
   
  * I think `windows-1252.py` converts Windows-only smart-quotes
    and things into their unicode &#decimal reference; equivalents.
